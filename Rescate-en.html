        <h2>STORIES ABOUT OUR CAMPERITOS</h2>
        <p>Here you will find the best stories of our camperitos. 
            Some of them have had a very hard life, but fortunately, people with big hearts have crossed their path and prayed for them. We receive them and give them back their dignity, the godmothers and godfathers accompany them during the recovery process, covering their needs. 
            Some of them were happily adopted, others are already stars and others are still waiting for a family.</p>

                        <h3>Gaucho</h3>
                        <p>Gaucho was found at the door of a barbecue. He was already crippled and in a desperate state.
                            The most incredible thing was that no one came to help him. He only received a bone or two from time to time.<br>
                            This is how our beloved Gaucho arrived at the shelter. Those who know him know that he has an imposing figure and a bark that leaves us speechless. 
                            But what we love most about Gaucho is his sweet and affectionate personality, he is always looking for a cuddle.</p>

                    <p>When he arrived he was badly injured and very scared. 
                        The blows he had received had caused a glaucoma in one of his eyes, which had to be removed because it was impossible to save it.
                        He managed to overcome his terror of humans, he managed to forgive us.<br>
                        Once recovered, our inveterate fighter found a family who decided to open the doors of their home to him, thus closing the circle of rescue, recovery and adoption. </p>

                        Bald, anemic and blind as a result of a severe stroke. But Toby, being young and strong, gradually recovered. 
                        Soon, his little hair began to grow and his little tail did not stop wagging. Today, after so much pain,
                         our fat boy lives happily in a home, with a family that did not hesitate to give him a second chance.</p>

                    <p>Esta cachorra, dueña de una mirada tan especial, tenía una familia que parecía amarla pero cuando adquirieron un Labrador decidieron dejarla en la calle.
                    La vida de esta perrita no fue nada fácil en la calle. Al ingresar al refugio, estaba muy desnutrida, con sarna y con la mandíbula completamente destrozada causada por un golpe muy fuerte.
                    Disney soportó tres cirugías. Hoy, nuestra gordita bella logró dejar atrás tanto dolor y vive feliz con una familia de oro.   </p>

                    <p>Benet had almost his entire body burned. A neighbor, angry that Benet had tried to ride his dog, had no better idea than to burn him alive. 
                        Thanks to the quick action of the local people, Benet was treated immediately. It was a long and grueling process. Little by little, he began to improve. And after so much effort and so much care, the long awaited day arrived. Benet was going up for adoption!

                    <p> Layza's condition upon entering the shelter was simply shocking. With a very thick rope tied around her neck, she arrived with a tumor that had affected her jaw and was tearing her skin. 
                        Gradually, after the tumor was removed, she began to eat solid food and how she loved it! Her eyes began to sparkle with hope. It was at the shelter that she met her mother, a wonderful person who was becoming harder and harder to leave every Saturday.</p>
